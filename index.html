        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Kamana Izere Emile. I am a fresh graduate out of highschool. I like being constantly learning and up to date on my knowledge.It's kinda funny but I chose to pursue a career in computer science because I liked games when I was a kid and got amazed in how people produce those and wanted absolutely to be part of that innovative world.</p>
